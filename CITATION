  abstract	= {We present an MDA framework, developed in the functional
		  programming language SML, that tries to bridge the gap
		  between formal software development and the needs of
		  industrial software development, e.g., code generation.
		  Overall, our tool-chain provides support for software
		  modeling using UML/OCL and guides the user from
		  type-checking and model transformations to code generation
		  and formal analysis of the UML/OCL model. We conclude with
		  a report on our experiences in using a functional language
		  for implementing MDA tools.},
