  * additional import formats (USE, Rational, etc)
  * additonal diagram types, e.g.,

    - sequence diagrams (input for test case generation)
    - use-case diagrams (templates for policy generation/analysis)
  * XMI Export (Rep -> XMI)
  * Codegenreator for GraphViz/UMLGraph/MetaUML
  * Framework for transformations (with proof obligation generation)
  * support for associations (work in progress)
