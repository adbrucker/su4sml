We here document coding-style guidelines that should be adhered to.
Much of the existing code is not yet following these guidelines, patches 
are welcome. (some of these guidelines even are not yet decided upon, 
these are marked by TBD, To Be Decided. Some of the SHOULDs might also
changed into MUSTs)

 1. structures, and exported types and functions SHOULD be documented
    (using smldoc)

 2. functions SHOULD be defined in their curried form: 
    fun f x y = ... instead of fun f(x,y) = ...

 3. TBD: camelCase vs seperated_by_underscore (we really should decide on one...)

 4. function names SHOULD be meaningful and unabbreviated 

 5. function names MUST be lowercase

 6. datatype names and datatype constructor names SHOULD be capitalized

 7. datatypes SHOULD be preferred to type synonyms
    in particular for record types

 8. structures SHOULD be given a signature

 9. structure names MUST be capitalized, and CamelCased

10. signature names MUST be ALL_CAPS.

11. TBD: signatures in separate .sig files or inline in the .sml file?

12. code MUST be portable among the supported sml systems 
    (currently: SML/NJ, MLTon, polyml in various versions)

13. source files SHOULD contain only one signature resp. structure.

14. source file names SHOULD reflect the structure/signature name.

15. source file names SHOULD be lowercase and seperated_by_underscore.
