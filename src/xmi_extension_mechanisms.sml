 * specific UML model elements are customized and extended with new semantics 
 * by using stereotypes, constraints, tag definitions, and tagged values. 
 * A coherent set of such extensions, defined for specific purposes,

 * The stereotype concept provides a way of branding (classifying) model 
 * elements so that they behave in some respects as if they were instances of 
 * new virtual metamodel constructs. These model elements have the same 
 * structure (attributes, associations, operations) as similar non-stereotyped 
 * model elements of the same kind. The stereotype may specify additional 
 * constraints and tag definitions that apply to model elements. In addition, 
 * a stereotype may be used to indicate a difference in meaning or usage 
 * between two model elements with identical structure.

(* from UML 1.5 Extension Mechanisms:-----------------------------------------
 * A tagged value allows information to be attached to any model element in 
 * conformance with its tag definition. Although a tagged value, being an 
 * instance of a kind of ModelElement, automatically inherits the name 
 * attribute, the name that is actually used in the tagged value is the name 
 * of the associated tag definition.
